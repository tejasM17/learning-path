#                                                     Conditional Statements in Python: if, elif, and else

#  Indentation in Python

# 1. The if Statement

#  The if statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is True, the block of code under the if statement is executed

time = 20  # 20 represents 8 PM in 24-hour format
if time == 20:
    print("It's time for dinner!")
    
    
# 2. The else Statement

time = 18  # 6 PM
if time == 20:
    print("It's time for dinner!")
else:
    print("It's not dinner time yet.")
    
    
#  3. The elif Statement

#  Letâ€™s create a system to check meal times based on the time of the day:

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
	print("b is greater than a")
elif a != b:
	print("a and b are not equal")
else :
	print ('none')
    
#    4. Comparison Operators in if Statements
    
    
# ==: Equal to
# !=: Not equal to
#  <: Less than
#  >: Greater than
#  <=: Less than or equal to
#  >=: Greater than or equal to

    print("Warning don't cross the speed limit")

elif speed < limit:
    print("have a good journy")
    
else:
    print("invalid input")
    
    
#    Write a program that takes a number as input and classifies it as:

#     :Positive, Negative, or Zero
#     :Even or Odd

elif a == 0:
    print(" enterd number is negetive ")
    
elif a % 2 ==0:
    print(" enterd number is even ")
    
elif a % 2 != 0:
    print(" enterd number is odd ")
    
else :
    
    print (" invalid input...! ")
